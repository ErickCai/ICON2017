## Hi there!
Welcome to the website for the ICON 2017 hackathon "multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) of fMRI data in Python"! On this website, you'll find some general info about the hackathon, how to prepare for it (in terms of Python prerequisites and environment), and the slides/notebooks/data that will be used during the hackathon.

## Scope/learning goals
This "hackathon" (or rather *workshop*, really) assumes that participants are familiar with analyzing (f)MRI data and want to know how they would go about implementing a machine-learning ("decoding") analysis in Python. As such, it's definitely helpful if you have *some* knowledge about Python's syntax, but it's not strictly necessary. Also, we assume participants are relatively unfamiliar with machine learning (ML) concepts and their implementation; if you're a ML guru, this is probably not the right workshop for you ... [some more stuff on what people will learn ...]

## How to prepare ...
For this hackathon, we expect participants to bring their own laptop. Given that you brought your own laptop, there are two options for working on the materials from the hackathon:

1. Install/configure Python on your own computer and download the materials. Please follow [these](configure_python.md) instructions on how to download and set-up Python correctly.

2. Request an account on our analysis-server. In that case, please email me (lukassnoek [at] gmail [dot] com) in advance. You would need to download [X2go](http://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php/doc:installation:x2goclient) - a remote desktop client - to access our server.

If possible, try to install Python on your own computer (option 1), as this will not have the problem of "lag" caused by the remote desktop client. Following the tutorials should be doable on a laptop with decent specs (i.e., at least 4 GB of RAM).

## ToDo:

- Lukas: run piop1 WM first-levels
- Lukas: data op surfdrive + download-script
- Lukas: python-refresher notebook
- Lukas: python installatie tutorial op website
- Steven: aanpassingen notebook

* design korter
* minder python programmeer dingetjes
* answer-notebook
* Figure out cell collapse

- Figure out IP van Beurs van Berlage (open zetten voor TUX)
